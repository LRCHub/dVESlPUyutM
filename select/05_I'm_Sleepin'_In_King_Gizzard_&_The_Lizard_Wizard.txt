I'm sleepin' in, in
I'm sleepin' in, ooh
I know within my body
I need rest from muscle ache
I really need a break
So I'm sleepin' in, in
I'm sleepin' in, ooh
I know within my body
I need to locate the switch
Hidden in me which
Will turn me off, off
Off, ooh
I know within my body
I need it, I need it
I need it, I need it
I'm sleepin' in, in
I'm sleepin' in, ooh
I'm sleepin' in, in
I'm sleepin' in, ooh
I know within my body
I've got sleepy appetite
Pray the darkest night
I'm sleepin' in, in
I'm sleepin' in, uh
I need it, I need it
I need it, I need it
I need it, I need it
I need it
