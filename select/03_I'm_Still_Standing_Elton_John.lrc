[00:11.88] You could never know what it's like
[00:14.23] Your blood like winter freezes just like ice
[00:16.63] And there's a cold lonely light that shines from you
[00:19.48] You'll wind up like the wreck you hide
[00:21.56] Behind that mask you use
[00:33.56] 
[00:25.32] And did you think this fool could never win
[00:27.67] Well look at me, I'm coming back again
[00:30.32] I got a taste of love in a simple way
[00:32.76] And if you need to know while I'm still standing
[00:35.10] You just fade away
[00:44.10] 
[00:37.87] Don't you know
[00:38.84] I'm still standing better than I ever did
[00:43.36] Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
[00:49.26] And I'm still standing after all this time
[00:54.41] Picking up the pieces of my life
[00:56.89] Without you on my mind
[01:07.89] 
[00:59.63] I'm still standing
[01:01.62] (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[01:04.87] I'm still standing
[01:07.02] (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[01:16.02] 
[01:11.53] Once I never could hope to win
[01:13.94] You starting down the road leaving me again
[01:16.53] The threats you made were meant to cut me down
[01:18.99] And if our love was just a circus
[01:21.39] You'd be a clown by now
[01:32.89] 
[01:24.29] You know, I'm still standing better than I ever did
[01:29.46] Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
[01:35.46] I'm still standing after all this time
[01:40.23] Picking up the pieces of my life
[01:42.84] Without you on my mind
[01:53.84] 
[01:45.54] I'm still standing
[01:47.82] (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[01:51.07] I'm still standing
[01:53.08] (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[02:02.08] 
[02:09.80] Don't you know that
[02:10.64] I'm still standing better than I ever did
[02:15.20] Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
[02:20.97] But I'm still standing after all this time
[02:26.26] Picking up the pieces of my life
[02:28.57] Without you on my mind
[02:39.57] 
[02:31.57] I'm still standing
[02:33.73] (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[02:36.70] I'm still standing
[02:38.83] (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[02:47.83] 
[02:42.20] I'm still standing
[02:44.42] (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[02:47.53] I'm still standing
[02:49.54] (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[02:53.04] I'm still standing
[02:55.11] (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
